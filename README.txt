# Customer Segmentation and Classification

The data used for this project is drawn from Kaggle and some online mall-customers

For clustering :- Hierarchial Agglomerative Clustering

* Objects that are closer are more related to each other in comparison of the objects that are far from each other.
* The main challenge  is that once it undergoes split or merge operation it can never be undone. 
* This challenge is profitable as it leads to smaller computation costs by not worrying about a combinatorial number of different choices. 

Using eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) method for classification
* XGB is a highly efficient boosting ensemble learning model originated in the DT model,.
* It uses the tree classifier for better results of prediction and higher operation efficiency.
